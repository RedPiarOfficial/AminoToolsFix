## Installation

Before running the script, make sure to install the necessary dependencies. The script will automatically install them if they are missing.

```python
try:
    from colorama import Fore, init
    from utils.Users import Users
except:
    os.system("pip install colorama")
    os.system("pip install sqlite3")
    input("Press Enter to restart script: ")
    sys.exit()
```

## Running
To run the script, execute the following command in CMD:

```
python AToolsFix.py
```

## Class and Method Descriptions
### AToolsFix Class
A class that provides functionality for interacting with the Amino API.

### login
Checks for the presence of the sid.txt file for authentication. If the file is not found, it prompts the user for their email and password to log in.

After a successful login, the sid.txt file is created. For subsequent logins, your SID will be used for authentication. When the SID expires, you will need to re-enter your email and password.

```python
def login(self):
    if os.path.exists("./sid.txt"):
        self.loginSID()
    else:
        email = input("[!] Enter your Email(AccountEmail): ")
        password = input("[!] Enter your Password(AccountPassword): ")
        print("Trying to log in to your account...")
        clientDATA = self.client.login(email, password)
        status = self.checkAccountLogin(LoginBySid=False)
        if status:
            os.system("cls")
            self.CreateSidFile(data=clientDATA)
            self.Functions()
```

Additionally, after each login attempt, a test request will be sent to Amino servers via checkAccountLogin.

```python
def checkAccountLogin(self, LoginBySid):
    try:
        self.client.get_wallet_info().totalCoins
        print("Login checked is True!")
        return True
    except:
        print("Login failed! Trying again...")
        time.sleep(3)
        if LoginBySid:
            os.remove("sid.txt")
        os.system("cls")
        self.login()
        return False
```

### Functions

To select a function, enter the corresponding number.

def Functions(self):
    os.system("cls")
    print("""
